# Software Requirements

Please follow the instruction below to meet the software requirements of the course:

1. Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (make sure to select 'Add python.exe to PATH' on the first Window and then select Install Now).
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/) (with default settings) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account.
3. Install [PyCharm (Professional Version)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) with default settings. 
PyCharm professional is free for students. Request license from 
[here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).
4. Follow these steps to select your Python interpreter in PyCharm:
    1. Open PyCharm (close any open projects). 
    2. On the Welcome to PyCharm window, select **Customize** from the left menu and 
        click on **All settings...** (on Mac, it might be called **Preferences**).
    3. Select **Python->Interpreter** from the left menu. The path to where the python is installed should be 
    already displayed in the text box next to Interpreter or in the drop-down menu when you click on text next to Interpreter. If you do not see this, you need to add the interpreter manually. Click on **Add Interpreter** and then select **Add Local Interpreter...**. From the left menu, select **System Interpreter**. The path to python.exe might be already displayed. If so, click OK; otherwise, click on the button next to Interpreter text box. Select the folder where python is installed on your computer. On my computer it is "C:\Users\ry87\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe" 
       (note that to find this folder you may need to click on the button 
       **Show Hidden Files and Directories** which is on the top of the window). 
     Click Ok.
    5. After selecting the interpreter, install the packages we need. Click on the small **+** button on the right.
     Search for **numpy** and select it. In the bottom of the page, select **Install to user's site packages directory**
      and then click on **Install Package**.
    6. Repeat the previous step for **deampy**, **scipy**, **matplotlib**, **statsmodels**, and **pandas**. Click OK.
5. To update Python packages, follow the steps 
[here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html),
 under Upgrading packages.
7. Do the homework on [Software Requirement](https://classroom.github.com/a/-iB92UDl) to make sure everything has been installed correctly.
    **Note**: When you open this assignment in PyCharm, go to File -> Settings, from the left menu, select 
    Python->Interpreter and make sure you  see the packages you just installed. 
    If not, expand the drop-down menu next to Project Interpreter and make sure the interpreter that we just defined 
    is selected. It should be something like "**Python 3.8** (C:\Users\ry87\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\python.exe)".
